				<h4><em>"Love From the First Note"</em></h4>
				<p>
					To start with I have to use the ending from the fairy tales "and they lived happily ever after ..." 
                    as this is the association I have with tango. This is a never-ending passionate relationship with ups and downs but one thing is sure: 
                    once involved you can always rely on tango, tango never lies to you, tango never cheats on you, tango calms you when you are upset, 
                    tango shares your sorrow, tango doubles your joy ...</P><br>
                    <p>
                    The beginning of my love story dates back to the year 2001. At that time nobody talked about tango in Estonia nor there were any materials about the dance.
                    I do not even know whether YouTube existed at that time. But even if it was already created I would not have known to look for videos of tango ... 
                    My friend, a dance teacher, had a dance studio in Tallinn at that time where he taught salsa, tap dance etc. It so happened that one day I attended the last but one class in his studio and when I had had my shower and tried to leave, the last class was almost ending. 
                    Luckily the studio was built in a way that entering or leaving the dressing room you had to go through the training room. So I stood there my hair wet and mouth open and my eyes like plates and ... listened to the music. The music! Incredible! I had never heard anything like this. 
                    Heck with the dancers. They were beginners and looked very awkward. When the class was finally over and me not paralyzed and longer, I started to bomb my friend with all kind of questions: what is this dance, what is this music, can I have the cd to listen to at home, can I come to the class to try. 
                    And I went to the class next week. But the joy of and from the dance did not come as in a month out of 4 students there were only 2. Women!!! So my friend stopped the classes.

				<h4><em>"The Dream"</em></h4>
				<p>
					Once upon a time there was a little girl in a small town in a tiny country. The little girl was like
					any other girl in that town.
					She took the ballet classes, attended the music school, played hide and seek with the neighbours'
					kids in the yard.
					The little girl liked to dream a lot. And she wanted to marry a boy who has black shiny leather
					shoes.
					The little girl is not that little any more and she still has not met a boy with black shiny leather
					shoes.
					But the little girl who is not that little any more still loves to dream.
					One of her dreams is now, at this very moment, in your eyes, in your ears, under your fingertips, in
					your heart. Her dream is all around you.

				<h4><em>"Brief History"</em></h4>
				<h4>1786</h4>
				<p>
					The Tango was developed in Spain and brought to Argentina through the African slaves and settlers.
					The name Tango was a term used for the dance that slaves and blacks did as documented in 1786.
					It was called the “balle con corte’ ” or dance with stop.
				</p>

					1850s choreography of The Tango, “a South American dance,” by M. Markowski of Paris, as described in
					1856 by Charles Durang of Philadelphia.
				</p>
				<h4>1875</h4>
				<p>
					Georges Bizet’s 1875 opera Carmen made the Habanera popular. Habanera is the popular name for
					“L’amour est un oiseau rebelle” (“Love is a rebellious bird”),
					and it’s beat structure influenced the Argentine Tango as well as the Cuban Danzon, Bolero and
					Rumba.
				</p>

					Argentina.

				<h4>1917</h4>
				<p>
					Folk singer Carlos Gardel begins writing tango music in Argentina.
				</p>
				<h4>1929</h4>
				<p>
					The great depression influenced the decline of the argentine Tango. The argentine Tango came back
					under the government of Juan Peron.
					The music of Calos Gardel inspired many until his death in 1935.
				</p>
				<h4>1930</h4>
				<p>
					International tango took on a new styling in the mid 1930’s, as a German couple took the
					competitions by storm with a staccato styling, faster music, and longer strides.
					This gave new life to the Tango and birth to the international style of Tango as we know it now.
				</p>
				<h4>1984</h4>
				<p>
					The Tango ban was lifted and it was officially dedicated as the dance of Argentina.
