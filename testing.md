## Testing

* Ran code through [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - no errors, except a warning "From line 42, column 3; to line 42, column 24- section lacks heading" - because it is an empty element. 

* Ran code through [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - no errors found.

* Created Lighthouse report through Devtools. You can manually access this through [Tango de Maret](https://kadrilaanes.github.io/Tango-de-Maret/), right-click "inspect", in the header click forward arrows, choose "Lighthouse" and pull the report.
