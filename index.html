<!---------------------------------------------Why Tango-->

              "When you think of Tango, what comes to mind first? Passion? Drama? Violence? Romance? Sex?
              Whatever it is, it is usually emotional in nature, primal and stirring of your senses. 
              Tango never elicits a ho-hum response, because there is nothing mundane or humdrum about it – it is a living and breathing feeling à deux that is danced.
              Tango invites you into an embrace whose arms you never want to leave.
              It is a dance of intertwined bodies engaged in a dialogue of limbs, which caress the floor and each other, creating a moving seduction. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Tango is language evolved."

             Once upon a time there was a little girl in a small town in a tiny country. The little girl was like any other girl in that town.
             She took the ballet classes, attended the music school, played hide and seek with the neighbours' kids in the yard. 
             The little girl liked to dream a lot. And she wanted to marry a boy who has black shiny leather shoes.
             The little girl is not that little any more and she still has not met a boy with black shiny leather shoes.
             But the little girl who is not that little any more still loves to dream.
             One of her dreams is now, at this very moment, in your eyes, in your ears, under your fingertips, in your heart. Her dream is all around you.

                <h4>1786</h4>
                <p>
                   The Tango was developed in Spain and brought to Argentina through the African slaves and settlers. 
                   The name Tango was a term used for the dance that slaves and blacks did as documented in 1786. 
                   It was called the “balle con corte’ ” or dance with stop.
                </p>
                <h4>1850</h4>
                <p>
                   1850s choreography of The Tango, “a South American dance,” by M. Markowski of Paris, as described in 1856 by Charles Durang of Philadelphia.
                </p>
                <h4>1875</h4>
                <p>
                   Georges Bizet’s 1875 opera Carmen made the Habanera popular. Habanera is the popular name for “L’amour est un oiseau rebelle” (“Love is a rebellious bird”), 
                   and it’s beat structure influenced the Argentine Tango as well as the Cuban Danzon, Bolero and Rumba.
                </p>
                <h4>1912</h4>
                <p>
                   The Argentine tango was absorbed into the general society with the passage of universal suffrage in Argentina.

                <h4>1917</h4>
                <p>
                   Folk singer Carlos Gardel begins writing tango music in Argentina.
                </p>
                <h4>1929</h4>
                <p>
                   The great depression influenced the decline of the argentine Tango. The argentine Tango came back under the government of Juan Peron. 
                   The music of Calos Gardel inspired many until his death in 1935.
                </p>
                <h4>1930</h4>
                <p>
                   International tango took on a new styling in the mid 1930’s, as a German couple took the competitions by storm with a staccato styling, faster music, and longer strides. 
                   This gave new life to the Tango and birth to the international style of Tango as we know it now.
                </p>
                <h4>1984</h4>
                <p>
                   The Tango ban was lifted and it was officially dedicated as the dance of Argentina.
