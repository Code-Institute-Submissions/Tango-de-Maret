## Milestone Project 1 

![TangodeMaret responsive](assets/photos/responsive.jpg)

"Tango de Maret" is an Argetinean tango dancer's professional website. It is the first Milestone Project using HTML, CSS and a framework, created for the "User Centric Frontend" module of the FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

Deployed web-site on: [Tango de Maret](https://kadrilaanes.github.io/Tango-de-Maret/)

### Open links with ctrl + click

## UX 

The purpose of the site is to provide simple, fast-loading and  easy to use format evoking interest in users to join a tango class. 

### User Stories: 

* As a user I can get inspired by what emotions tango evokes, who is Maret and get a brief over-view of the history of Argentinean tango.
* As a user I can find information about when and where tango classes take place and where tango parties are organised with additional references to the organisation's social media pages.
* As a user I can get convinced why learn to tango with Maret.
* As a user I can contact Maret.

## Features 

* A fixed header - navigation between 4 pages, fixed, so the user can always navigate.
* Home - has an introduction to tango, introduction to Maret's dream about tango and a brief over-view of the history of the dance.
* Classes & Events - an overview of where and when do classes and events take place.
* Facebook icons- to navigate to the mentioned organisation's facebook communities.
* About Me - a biography of Maret.
* Contact - a contact form. 
* Footer - simple copyright footer.

## Feature/Design/UX Elements Left to Implement 

* Maret's Stories - a page with Maret's short stories and aphorisms. She writes inspiring texts.
* Replace the text of Classes & Events into calendars so that users can add them into their own calendars to be more UX friendly.
* Instead of one of the color-columns on index.html, I would like to add an Argentinean tango video with dancers, using the color layer as an overlay.

## Project barriers and solutions

* The resonsiveness of all the different sized text/color/photo section-divisions was a challenge. The text was cut/hidden on smaller resolutions. Therefore I manually set each sections' custom minimum-height.
* "Why Tango?" section image "portrait-of-Maret"-  purpose of the photo diminishes on the Ipad width, meaning, the face area of the image goes hidden. The photo needs to be cut so it shifts better.
* After user testing it was mentioned that after clicking the hero image area arrow to jump to the next section, the title of the "Why Tango?" is hidden. That is due to the space the fixed navbar is taking over. I corrigated the margin and padding of the title and the paragraph. 

## Validation

* Ran code through [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - no errors, except a warning "From line 42, column 3; to line 42, column 24- section lacks heading" - because it is an empty element used for styiling in CSS.

* Ran code through [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - no errors found.

* Created Lighthouse report through Devtools. You can manually access this through [Tango de Maret](https://kadrilaanes.github.io/Tango-de-Maret/), right-click "inspect", in the header click forward arrows, choose "Lighthouse" and pull the report.
