"Tango de Maret" is an Argetinean tango dancer's professional website. It is the first Milestone Project created for the "User Centric Frontend" module of my FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

## UX ##

The purpose of the site is to provide simple, easy to use format evoking interest in users to join a tango class. 

### User Stories: ###

* As a user I can get inspired by what emotions tango evokes, who is Maret and get a brief over-view of the history of Argentinean tango.
* As a user I can find information about when and where tango classes take place and where tango parties are organised with additional references to the organisation's social media pages.
* As a user I can get convinced why learn to tango with Maret.
* As a user I can contact Maret.

## Features ##

* Home - has an introduction to tango, introduction to Maret's dream about tango and a brief over-view of the history of the dance.
* Classes & Events - an overview of where and when do classes and events take place.
* About Me - a small biography of Maret.
* Contact - a contact form. 

## Feature/Design/UX Elements Left to Implement ## 

* Maret's Stories - a page with Maret's short stories and aphorisms. She can write inspiring texts.
* Replace the text of Classes & Events into calendars so that users can add them into their own calendars to be more UX friendly.
* To make the page more inviting to tango add a video with with tango tango dancers dancing to tango music, creating atmosphere- as music is the most imporant element. I don't have a video with copyright at the moment.
