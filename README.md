## Milestone Project 1 

![TangodeMaret responsive](assets/photos/responsive.jpg)

"Tango de Maret" is an Argetinean tango dancer's professional website. It is the first Milestone Project using HTML, CSS and a framework, created for the "User Centric Frontend" module of the FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

## UX 

The purpose of the site is to provide simple, fast-loading and  easy to use format evoking interest in users to join a tango class. 

### User Stories: 

* As a user I can get inspired by what emotions tango evokes, who is Maret and get a brief over-view of the history of Argentinean tango.
* As a user I can find information about when and where tango classes take place and where tango parties are organised with additional references to the organisation's social media pages.
* As a user I can get convinced why learn to tango with Maret.
* As a user I can contact Maret.

## Features 

* A fixed header - navigation between 4 pages.
* Home - has an introduction to tango, introduction to Maret's dream about tango and a brief over-view of the history of the dance.
* Classes & Events - an overview of where and when do classes and events take place.
* About Me - a biography of Maret.
* Contact - a contact form. 
* Footer - simple copyright footer.

## Feature/Design/UX Elements Left to Implement 

* Maret's Stories - a page with Maret's short stories and aphorisms. She writes inspiring texts.
* Replace the text of Classes & Events into calendars so that users can add them into their own calendars to be more UX friendly.
* Instead of one of the color-columns on index.html, I would like to add an Argentinean tango video with dancers, using the color layer as an overlay.

## Project barriers and solutions

* The resonsiveness of all the different sized text/color/photo section-divisions was a challenge. The text was cut/hidden on smaller resolutions. Therefore I manually set each sections' minimum-height.
* "Why Tango?" image "portrait-of-Maret" the purpose of the photo diminishes on the Ipad resolutions- working on cutting the photo, so that the face would still be visible.
